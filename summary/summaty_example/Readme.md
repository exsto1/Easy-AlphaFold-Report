# Summary example

Here you can find a preview of an exemplary search report.<br>
In pdf files above you can find the results for search for *'test_file2.txt'* (available in Easy-AlphaFold-Report/config/other directory).

The content consists of three pdf files corresponding to the three sections of generated html summary: General Summary, AlphaFold Predictions and AlphaFold links.

#### General Summary
Here you can find information about your input: nuber of detected id's in your input, number of input id's wich were recognized as identifiers existing in databases of interest (Pfam, UniProt, PDB).
In this section you can also find basic statistics from UniProt corresponding to your entry.
The third part of the section displays information about pLDDT scores of AlphaFold predictions found for proteins from the input.
You can find here what is the total number of AlphaFold predictions for your query, which structure has the best mean pLDDT score and what is the mean of pLDDT scores for all found AlphaFold predictions.
The plots at the bottom of the page enable you to inspect the per-residue pLDDT in found structures.


#### AlphaFold Predictions
In this section you can inspect AlphaFold predictions' 3D structure using interactive 3D visualisations.
Predictions with best and worst mean pLDDT are marked with green and red colours appropirately.

#### AlphaFold Links
In this section you can find all AlphaFold predictions gathered together, sorted by pLDDT value. Each structure has a refference to it's AlphaFold page.
