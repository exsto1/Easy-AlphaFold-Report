1. General summary data
    Pandas DataFrame
    
    columns = ["ID", "was_entry_found", "Database", "how_many_structures", "how_many_predictions"]
    
    - ID: str | user input (single query or many queries if file provided as input)
    - was_db_entry_found: bool | was ID found in Pfam/Uniprot/PDB
    - Database: str | name of database from {"PDB", "Uniprot", "Pfam"} or NaN if was_db_entry_found == False
    - how_many_structures: int | how many Uniprot structures were found for given ID
    - how_many_predictions: int | <= how_many_structures; how many structures have alphafold predictions
