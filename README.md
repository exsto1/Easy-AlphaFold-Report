## Project main goal
Easy-AlphaFold-Report is a package with the aim of processing
data between databases easier and faster for the user.

Users can provide input in multiple formats - Pfam families, clans, Uniprot or PDB.
Additionally, for even easier access for less tech-savvy users, the main script
enables the use of a convenient GUI for a more click-oriented experience.

As a result, users can expect an interactive and easy to read report
with a summary of a provided dataset with a focus on AlphaFold database features.
To help with the analysis, basic statistics are also calculated for a quick overview.


Instead of clicking through multiple sites, and finding connections between
databases, this package will do the work for you and if you still want to verify
the results, or grab more data links on the report can send you to the respective
websites.

Optionally during the summary process, the user can also choose to keep
the data from AlphaFold in the .cif files (cif is a more descriptive alternative
for PDB files).

## Project features
- Flexible input providing (direct input, files).
- Convenient usage via GUI.
- Various data type recognition and parsing (Pfam families, clans, PDB, Uniprot).
- Automatic database updates.
- ID verification.
- Data collection from multiple databases (PDB, PFAM, Uniprot, AlphaFold).
- Optional data download from AlphaFold (.cif files)
- Presenting results and statistics in the intuitive and interactive html.

## Usage

For the basic version with GUI user needs to simply run the main python script:
```
python open_autogui.py
```
This should open an interactive window ready to use.

### Input

In the interactive version, the user can provide ID manually
via a dedicated box or use a file selector to provide a path to the file.
The file should contain 1 ID per line.

For programmatic access, terminal input is also available and uses
the same script as a base - but with manual flags:


### Flags:

| Flag | Type  | Description                          |
|------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| -g   | BOOL  | Open in GUI mode (DEF: True)         |
| -i   | PATH  | Input (path to file - 1 ID per line) |
| -o   | PATH  | Output (path to summary file)        | 
| -d   | BOOL  | Download (DEF: False)                |
